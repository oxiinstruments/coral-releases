<strong>Additive</strong> synthesis with <strong>Wavefolding</strong> and <strong>Diode</strong> emulation distortion.
This firmware includes 3 drums models packed in two engines. 

## Controls

- Harm controls the harmonic content center
- Timbre: wavefolding amount
- Morph: Diode distortion amount
