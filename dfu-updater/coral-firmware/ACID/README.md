## ACID engine

This firmware includes the new ACID engine.

A variable-shape virtual analog oscillator that seamlessly morphs from the classics Saw to Square waveforms with dynamic PWM capabilities. There are two post-filter distortions and the edgy filter has been finely tuned for a gritty sound. 

## Controls

  - Harm controls the overdrive distortion
  - Timbre defines the oscillator waveform
  - Morph adds wavefolder distortion

## Notes

Controlling both distortions separately provides a wider sonic palette. 

How to get glides?

- Use a pair of CV and Gate and send glides from your sequencer.
- If using MIDI, create a MONO (1-voice) part and play with the Glide amount control (CC 7). 

How to get accents?

- You can fed CV modulation to any of these (for example the Vel or Mod outputs of a sequencer):
  - AMP, Filter, Timbre, Harm 
- With MIDI you can play with the velocity levels.
